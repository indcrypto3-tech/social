# Component Testing Report

## ❌ Component Issue: Get Started Button

**Page:**
Landing Page (`/`)

**Component Type:**
Button

**Expected Behavior:**
Should navigate to a registration page (`/register`) or login page, or scroll to a relevant section.

**Actual Behavior:**
Clicking the button resulted in no navigation or visible action. The URL remained `https://social-one-ivory.vercel.app/`.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to Landing Page (`/`).
2. Click "Get Started" button in the hero section.
3. Observe no change in URL or page state.


**Impact:**
High (Primary CTA is non-functional)

### ✅ Fix Applied
**Root Cause:**
The "Get Started" button was a UI component without any navigation logic (`onClick` or `Link` wrapper).

**Fix Summary:**
Wrapped the "Start Free Trial" button in a `Link` component pointing to `/register` and "View Demo" to `#features`.

**Files Modified:**
- frontend/components/landing/Hero.tsx

**Verification:**
Clicking the button now correctly navigates the user to the registration page.

## ❌ Component Issue: Forgot Password Link

**Page:**
Login Page (`/login`)

**Component Type:**
Link

**Expected Behavior:**
Should navigate to a password recovery page/form.

**Actual Behavior:**
Link anchor is `#`. Clicking it causes no navigation; it stays on `/login`.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to Login Page (`/login`).
2. Click "Forgot your password?" link.
3. Observe URL changes to `.../login#` but no page change.


**Impact:**
Medium (User cannot recover password)

### ✅ Fix Applied
**Root Cause:**
The "Forgot your password?" link had a placeholder `href="#"` and no corresponding route or logic existed.

**Fix Summary:**
- Created a new `/forgot-password` page with an email submission form.
- Implemented `resetPassword` server action using Supabase Auth.
- Updated the link on the Login page to point to `/forgot-password`.

**Files Modified:**
- frontend/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx
- frontend/app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx
- frontend/app/(auth)/actions.ts

**Verification:**
Clicking the link navigates to the reset password page, where users can request a reset link.

## ❌ Component Issue: Logout Interaction (Usability)

**Page:**
Dashboard Shell (Global)

**Component Type:**
Button (in Dropdown)

**Expected Behavior:**
Clicking the User Avatar should open a menu with a clearly accessible "Logout" button.

**Actual Behavior:**
Logout button requires precise interaction or is not immediately obvious in the DOM structure, leading to potential difficulties in ending the session.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Login to Dashboard.
2. Click User Avatar to open menu.
3. Attempt to locate/click "Log out".


**Impact:**
Low (Usability friction)

### ✅ Fix Applied
**Root Cause:**
The logout menu item had small effective hit area and standard styling, making it less obvious/accessible.

**Fix Summary:**
Increased the padding (`p-3`) and font weight (`font-medium`) of the Logout dropdown item to improve clickability and visibility.

**Files Modified:**
- frontend/app/(dashboard)/components/header.tsx

**Verification:**
The Logout button is now larger and easier to click within the user dropdown menu.

## ⚠️ Observation: Post Now Button Visibility

**Page:**
Composer Page (`/composer`)

**Component Type:**
Button

**Expected Behavior:**
"Post Now" button should be visible, possibly disabled if invalid state.

**Actual Behavior:**
"Post Now" button was not found in the DOM hierarchy when no accounts are connected.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Navigate to `/composer` with no social accounts connected.
2. Look for "Post Now" button.


**Impact:**
Low (Likely intended behavior, but could be clearer with a disabled state + tooltip)

### ✅ Fix Applied
**Root Cause:**
The "Schedule Post" button logic did not account for the "no accounts connected" state visually, making it appear missing or non-functional to users expecting a "Post" action.

**Fix Summary:**
Updated the button to show "Connect Accounts" when no accounts are linked, and redirect to the accounts page upon clicking.

**Files Modified:**
- frontend/app/(dashboard)/composer/page.tsx

**Verification:**
If no accounts are connected, the button clearly prompts to "Connect Accounts" and handles the redirection.


---

✅ All other tested components in Account, Calendar, Media, Analytics, Team, and Settings pages passed visual verification (rendering, visibility) during the spot-check passes.

### ❌ Backend Logic Issue (via Frontend)

**Production URL:**
https://social-one-ivory.vercel.app

**Flow Tested:**
Authentication: Login → Logout

**Frontend Trigger:**
User clicks User Avatar in the header, then clicks "Logout" in the dropdown menu.

**Expected Backend Behavior:**
The backend (via Server Action) should invalidate the session | cookie and redirect the user to the Landing Page or Login Page.

**Observed Result:**
The Dashboard page reloads or stays as is. The user remains authenticated. Navigation to other protected pages works, confirming the session is still active.

**Likely Backend Area:**
Auth

**Impact:**
Critical (Security Risk: Users cannot terminate their session)

---

### ⚠️ Backend Validation Summary

**Validated Flows:**
1.  **Signup & Login:** ✅ Working (Redirects to Dashboard properly).
2.  **Feature Page Access:** ✅ Dashboard, Media, Accounts, Composer, Analytics, Team, Billing pages all load successfully (Response 200).
3.  **Media Upload:** ⚠️ Not fully automated, but UI elements are present.
4.  **Logout:** ❌ FAILED (See above).
